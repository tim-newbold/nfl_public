# üèà NFL ETL Engine (Python + SQL Server)

This repository contains a Python-based ETL engine that pulls NFL data using the [`nfl_data_py`](https://nfl-data-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) API and loads it into a local SQL Server database. The data can then be used for dashboards, analysis, or machine learning models.
